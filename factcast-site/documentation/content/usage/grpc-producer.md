## GRPC Producer

#### FactCast.publish(List&lt;Fact&gt; factsToPublish)

In order to produce Facts, you need to create Fact Instances and publish them via ```FactCast.publish()```.

On method return, the publishing of all the Facts passed to ```FactCast.publish()``` as a parameter are expected to have been written to PostgreSQL sucessfully. The order of the Facts is preserved while inserting into the database. All the inserts are done in a transactional context, so that the atomicity is preserved.

If the method returns exceptionally, of the process is killed or interrupted in any way, you cannot know if the Facts have been sucessfully written. In that case, just repeat the call: if the write ha dgone through you'll get and exception complaining about duplicate IDs, if not â€“ you may have a chance to succeed now.

#### FactCast.publishWithMark(List&lt;Fact&gt; factsToPublish)

This variant puts an extra Fact at the end of the List, whose ID is returned. The purpose for this is for consumers to be able to recognize, when all Facts of this call have been received. You may want to use this capability when trying to make up for the eventual consistency when creating synchronous interfaces.

#### FactCast.publish\[WithMark\](Fact toPublish)

acts the same way, than the List counterparts above, just for a List of one (two when using mark) Fact.

## Example Code

Here is some example code assuming you use the Spring GRPC Client:

```java
@Component
class Foo{
 @Autowired
 FactCast fc;

 public void someMethod(){
   fc.publish( new SomethingHappenedFact() );

   UUID idOfTheMarkFact = fc.publishWithMark( new SomethingElseHappenedFact() );
 }
}
```
