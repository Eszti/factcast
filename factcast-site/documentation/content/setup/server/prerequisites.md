## Postgres

In Order to run the factcast server, you have to provide a Postgres database at least in version 9.4.
The suggested configuration is to provide a _ddl user_ which will take care of creating all the necessary database objects. The _ddl user_ will also create a dedicated _application user_ during the initial startup. That user has a minimum number of privileges and should be used by the main data source for making queries during runtime.
The _ddl user_ has to be a superuser, as he will also install Postgres modules like [uuid-ossp](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/uuid-ossp.html).

The following example shows the suggested configuration. The [factcast-example project](https://github.com/Mercateo/factcast/tree/master/factcast-examples/factcast-example-server) also contains that properties.

```
spring.liquibase.user="ddl-user" //that user has to be provided
spring.liquibase.password="ddl-user-pw"
spring.datasource.username="factcast-application-user" // application-user generated by the factcast on startup
spring.datasource.password="factcast-application-user" // default pw, you may want to change this after initial startup
```



<details><summary>Read that, if you don't want to provide a superuser </summary>
<p>

If you don't want to provide a superuser as the _ddl user_, you have to consider the following points:

1.) The _ddl user_ needs the permission to create other users. Otherwise he is unable to create the _application user_ and the application start will fail.

2.) The Factcast needs the Postgres module [uuid-ossp](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/uuid-ossp.html). You have to install that module manually. The server will recognize the already installed module and it won't throw an error caused by missing privileges.
Login into your Postgres console and execute the following command as superuser:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```
