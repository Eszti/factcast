## Using FactCast client in Spring boot via REST

When it comes to REST, there are basically two camps:

* The RESTafaris, that claim that *RESTful* without HATEOAS is not even REST, but rather JSON via HTTP
* The others that use *RESTful* as a means of RPC.

Without going into which ones are right or wrong, here are two (out of many) options of how to use the FactCast REST API.

### HateOAS client

### Feign client
